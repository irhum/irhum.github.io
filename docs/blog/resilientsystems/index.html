<p>Our everyday lives revolve around well-abstracted systems that have clear cause and effect mechanisms. I flip a switch, the light turns on; the specifics of the electricity grid are irrelevant. I keep money at the bank, the bank gives me interest. I pay for supplies at the store, now I can take them home.</p>
<p>But when it comes to <em>changing</em> systems, our everyday cause and effect intuition fails us. Increasing dollars spent per child at schools doesn’t seem to improve educational outcomes. (Where does the money go?). Countries that impose travel restrictions a few days before their neighbors have exponentially lower fatalities from COVID-19. Teams whose members gel well outperform teams with more accomplished individuals, but lower team cohesion.</p>
<p>Linear changes produce nonlinear results. The whole is not its sum. Our intuition flies out the window.</p>
<p>This essay briefly explores these phenomena through the paradigm of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory">systems thinking</a>. Of particular interest are a class of systems called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system">Complex Systems</a>, which seem to evade reductionist, clean explanations. They’re complex, <em>not</em> because they’re complicated; it’s because even simple yet nonlinear <em>interactions</em> between their components give rise to rich behavior that cannot be understood in terms of any one individual factor <span class="citation" data-cites="Meadows1982">(<a href="#ref-Meadows1982" role="doc-biblioref">Meadows, 1982</a>)</span>. Our goal here is to take a “whole systems” view of why many of these complex systems exhibit <em>resilience</em> to change, by examining their underlying dynamics; more specifically, their <em>attractors</em>.</p>
<p>We start by exploring attractors with the Lorenz system, then introduce causal loop diagrams as duals to differential equations, concluding with the impacts of attractors on climate change policies.</p>
<section id="the-lorenz-system" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lorenz-system">The Lorenz System</h2>
<p>The Lorenz System is a classic set of three differential equations. It’s a useful model, as while the dynamics of the three components can be succinctly summarized in the three equations, they give rise to highly dynamic, chaotic behavior<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that is a characteristic of many real world systems. Specifically, the equations describe the evolution over time of three variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Lorenz_1963">(<a href="#ref-Lorenz_1963" role="doc-biblioref">Lorenz, 1963</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}=\sigma(y-x) \\
&amp;\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} t}=x(\rho-z)-y \\
&amp;\frac{\mathrm{d} z}{\mathrm{d} t}=x y-\beta z
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>You can think of them as representing any physical quantity of your choice (fish populations, air temperature, etc.) What’s key here is to examine how these variables <em>interact</em> with each other. When the system is integrated over time, we get three time series each for <span class="math inline">\((x(t), t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((y(t), t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((z(t), t)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="assets/timeseries.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption margin-caption">At best it just looks like three rather peculiar time series.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However, this isn’t very insightful. Alternatively, we can think of the values of all three variables for a given time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to represent a single point <span class="math inline">\((x(t), y(t), z(t))\)</span>. We can then plot these points in 3D space over different values of t, from start to end:</p>
<p><img src="assets/phasespace.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In doing so, we can visualize the overall <em>dynamics</em> of the whole system over time. It’s important enough that it has its own name: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space"><em>phase space</em></a>, which represents all possible states of the system (in this case, all possible values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>). The visualization here reveals a pattern: The trajectory through time for the state of the system <span class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> isn’t erratic or covering all of 3D space, but a rather limited, butterfly shaped subset.</p>
<p>This could very well be an anomaly; perhaps our starting condition was special. So let’s start at 10 different points, and produce 10 different trajectories:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="assets/phasespace2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption margin-caption">Regardless of where the trajectory begins, it converges to moving on the butterfly attractor. Points are start points, corresponding colored lines are trajectories.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As we see, regardless of the starting conditions <span class="math inline">\((x(t_0), y(t_0), z(t_0))\)</span>, in the Lorenz system, the trajectories converge to moving on the butterfly-shaped subset of 3D space.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This subspace has a name: the attractor <em>manifold</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. This convergence is true of any system with an attractor: given it runs for long enough, regardless of the initial starting point, it will become limited to moving only on the attractor manifold.</p>
<p>Attractors are emergent properties of a system: none of the three components in this system individually are responsible for this butterfly shaped subspace. Rather, it’s the interactions <em>between</em> them that give rise to the attractors. The system, as a whole, produces its own dynamics and attractors.</p>
</section>
<section id="attractors-and-feedback-loops" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attractors-and-feedback-loops">Attractors and Feedback Loops</h2>
<p>Real systems have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback">feedback loops</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Meadows1982">(<a href="#ref-Meadows1982" role="doc-biblioref">Meadows, 1982</a>)</span> which, over time tend to balance out. This leads to the system to only move around in states that are a small subset of all possible states, that is, an attractor manifold.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s use a more grounded example: suppose there is an island of rabbits and foxes, and we’d like to model their populations. We make the following simplifying assumptions:<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of rabbits the island can support is limited at <span class="math inline">\(r_{\text{max}}\)</span> due to limited vegetation available as food.</li>
<li>Rabbits can only die from being consumed by foxes (not from natural causes).</li>
<li>Foxes only eat rabbits, and nothing else.</li>
<li>This is an isolated ecosystem, with the only interaction being between rabbits and foxes.</li>
<li>The population of rabbits and foxes are continuous.</li>
<li>The feedback is instant, that is, the population of foxes begins to adjust instantly to any change in the rabbit population, and vice versa.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<section id="feedback-loops" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feedback-loops">Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>The dynamics of populations of foxes and rabbits can then be described as following.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Importantly, both of these views describe the <em>same</em> underlying reality, just through different lenses.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="assets/loops.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption margin-caption">On the causal loop diagram on the right, a solid arrow represents a <em>positive</em> relation (if A → B, if A goes up, B goes up), whereas a dashed arrow represents a <em>negative</em> relation (if A goes up, B goes down)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The differential equations perspective is useful for understanding the behavior of individual components of the system (individual populations of foxes and rabbits). However, the dynamics of the <em>whole system</em> are not as obvious (what’s the effect of the <span class="math inline">\(r_{\text{max}}\)</span> on the fox population?). On the other hand, what we have on the right, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram">causal loop diagram</a> is clearer. We can immediately start to infer information about the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>More rabbits results in more foxes (positive relation). However, more foxes result in fewer rabbits (negative relation). These two relations combine to form a <em>balancing</em> feedback loop,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> such that the populations of both stay relatively constant. <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If there are more rabbits than the maximum number of rabbits that can survive on the island (<span class="math inline">\(r &gt; r_{\text{max}}\)</span>), then the difference becomes negative. Since the difference has a positive relation with the rabbit population (but the value itself is negative!), the rabbit population declines. This decline then increases the difference back to a positive value (such that <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; r_{\text{max}}\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>We can even glean second-order and higher order effects from the causal loop diagram!<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> For instance, more foxes has a positive relation with the difference <span class="math inline">\(r_{\text{max}} - r\)</span>. This is because more foxes result in fewer rabbits, and fewer rabbits pushes the difference toward a more positive value. (In general, two negative relations together form a positive relation, just like in ordinary arithmetic)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can indeed verify that the predictions made by the causal loop diagram are consistent with what you’d obtain by analyzing the differential equations. For instance, one prediction (the dashed self loop from foxes to itself) is more foxes leads to less foxes (as they die off in larger numbers). This directly corresponds to the <span class="math inline">\(-\gamma f\)</span> term in the second equation. Each of the arrows on the right correspond to terms <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> in the differential equations on the left.</p>
<p>These loops increase and decrease in strength, until they balance each other.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Here, this results in a steady population of foxes and rabbits. This steady state of the system of course, is our attractor, which in this case is a single point.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the <em>feedback loops never stop</em>! Even if the overall population remains constant, the rabbits and foxes continue to undergo birth and death. The individual components of the system remain dynamic even if the overall system stays at the attractor point.</p>
</section>
<section id="resilience" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resilience">Resilience</h3>
<p>If a system is disrupted, feedback loops will work to push the system back towards the attractor. To illustrate this, suppose on day 10 a ship full of rabbits crashes onto the island. This change is represented by the blue arrow on both the time series and phase space plots:</p>
<p><img src="assets/predprey.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Even though the system is changed significantly, it ends up returning to its attractor! There’s some great dynamics going on here, so let’s put both our Differential Equations and Complex Systems lenses on and analyze this:</p>
<section id="the-differential-equations-lens" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-differential-equations-lens">The Differential Equations lens</h5>
<p>The derivatives of both rabbit and fox populations change to values with much larger magnitudes. We can see this directly on the phase plot, where the system has been pushed into a region of phase space with stronger derivatives (represented by the arrows). The population of foxes and rabbits continues to evolve according to the derivatives, until it converges back to the attractor point.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-complex-systems-lens" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-complex-systems-lens">The Complex Systems lens</h5>
<p>Due to the disruption, the feedback loops become abnormally strong, with considerably more rabbits being eaten, and foxes being born that usual. However, this change isn’t permanent, as the system is returned to its attractor point by the feedback loops balancing themselves out again. Once at the attractor, the feedback loops have returned to their “usual” values, representing the typical births and deaths in the system.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="summary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>As we just saw, both differential equations and causal loop diagrams are <em>complementary</em> approaches. Neither is necessarily superior to, or always better than the other. Rather, both provide information about the system at different levels (differential equations at the level of individual components, causal loop diagrams at the level of the whole system) that allow us to effectively analyze the system at multiple scales at once.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="attractors-in-the-real-world" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attractors-in-the-real-world">Attractors in the real world</h2>
<p>In the context of systems, both real and simulated, attractors <em>are</em> stability, and feedback loops are what <em>drive</em> them toward stability. You can push them beyond their usual states, but (within reasonable bounds) their feedback loops will drive them back to their attractors. Real systems do have some differences compared to the simplified predator-prey model above:</p>
<section id="non-point-attractors" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-point-attractors">Non-point attractors</h4>
<p>Many real systems do have attractors that are singular points. For instance, a pendulum has an attractor at the point of zero velocity and zero degrees from the vertical. This is because of air drag, as no matter where in the phase space of angle and velocity it starts at, it will eventually lose all velocity and end up back at zero. These attractors are easier to find, as they’re simply points where the gradient is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, many <em>complex</em> systems have attractors that are <em>not</em> points.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Indeed, for many real complex systems like the human, a point attractor is effectively death. Their attractor manifolds take on the shapes of lines, curves, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_cycle">loops</a>, or as is quite common with chaotic systems, even fractals (they’re called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor">strange attractors</a>. The attractor of the Lorenz system is one such example). This variety means that systems continue to <em>move</em> on the attractor manifold, with their states changing, never reaching equilibrium.</p>
<section id="example-breathing" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-breathing">Example: Breathing</h5>
<p>A straightforward example is that of a human breathing: our lungs don’t converge to a “equilibrium” (that’d be terrible news!), but rather cycle through the typical states (inhale in, exhale out) to produce the breathing pattern. This continues until you temporarily disrupt the pattern with an external input (say, a friend challenges you to hold your breath, so you consciously stop).</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chaotic-behavior">Chaotic Behavior</h4>
<p>Real systems tend to exhibit <em>chaotic</em> behavior. Crucially, this is not the same as random. Chaotic means you could predict the state of the system at any future time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> <em>if</em> you could measure the initial state to infinite decimal places <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell_2009">(<a href="#ref-Mitchell_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Mitchell, 2009</a>)</span>. Unfortunately, we do not have infinite precision. And in chaotic systems, even points that start out extremely close (say, due to a small measurement error) diverge quickly<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, resulting in highly erroneous predictions the further out we predict. We can still say the trajectory will remain on the attractor manifold over the long term, we just don’t know <em>exactly</em> where.</p>
<section id="example-weather-forecasting" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-weather-forecasting">Example: Weather Forecasting</h5>
<p>Chaos is why it’s challenging to predict the weather more than a few days in advance: the weather likely follows long term, deterministic dynamics, but our measurements have finite precision. Even small errors add up exponentially quickly the further out the prediction.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Nonetheless, we can still say the weather will remain around its typical state (say, around 20°C), instead of somehow becoming 200°C.</p>

<section id="multiple-attractors" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multiple-attractors">Multiple Attractors</h3>
<p>Real systems tend to have <em>multiple</em> attractors <span class="citation" data-cites="Ott_2006">(<a href="#ref-Ott_2006" role="doc-biblioref">Ott, 2006</a>)</span>. Points in the phase space that will converge to a specific attractor are part of the attractor’s <em>basin of attraction</em>. You can think of the basins as <em>partitions</em> of the phase space. Normally, systems remain on their current attractor manifold, unless an <em>external force</em> pushes them into the basin of attraction of a different attractor, at which point their dynamics will take place on the <em>new</em> attractor manifold.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">

<p><img src="assets/basins.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption margin-caption">The colored regions represent each of the three basins of attraction. The colored circles represent the attractor points themselves.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For example, even the simplified predator-prey system above actually has <em>three</em> attractors, with three corresponding basins of attraction.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first basin of attraction was the one we saw above, with the corresponding basin being all points in phase space where the population of rabbits is greater than 0. In general, this converges to <span class="math inline">\((\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha(\delta - \gamma k)}{\beta \delta})\)</span>. For the parameters we used,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> this is <span class="math inline">\((0.33, 0.38)\)</span></li>
<li>The second basin is all points where the population of <em>rabbits</em> is 0, in which case the number of foxes will also become zero (because there’s no food!). This always converges to <span class="math inline">\((0, 0)\)</span>, regardless of the starting number of foxes.</li>
<li>The third basin is all points where the population of <em>foxes</em> is 0. With no foxes, the rabbit population grows until it reaches the maximum the island can support, which is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{k}\)</span>. Our attractor is <span class="math inline">\((\frac{1}{k}, 0)\)</span>, and for the parameters used this is <span class="math inline">\((1.34, 0)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which attractor the system converges to depends on where it starts out at. But just as importantly, external forces can <em>push</em> the system from the basin of attraction of one attractor to a different one. If there’s no foxes, and we introduce one, we push the system from basin 3 to basin 1. Likewise, if there’s both foxes and rabbits, and we take every last rabbit off the island, we push the system from basin 1 to basin 2.</p>
<p>Systems are resilient on their own, but external forces <em>can</em> push them too far, at which point their dynamics change, because the basin of attraction the system is in has changed!</p>
<section id="multiple-attractors-and-disruption" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multiple-attractors-and-disruption">Multiple attractors and disruption</h4>
<p>From the perspective of complex systems, a disruptive technology and an ecological collapse are the same thing: the system being pushed towards a new attractor. If an external force pushes a system too far, it’ll keep balancing itself until it is pushed over a <em>critical point</em>, which divides two basins of attraction. Once it is pushed into the new basin of attraction, different feedback loops “take over”, causing it to converge to the <em>other</em> attractor.</p>
<section id="example-climate-change" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-climate-change">Example: climate change</h5>
<p>With human-induced climate change, the earth still appears relatively stable, as even with increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the other components in the system (e.g.&nbsp;ocean acidity levels) act as counterbalances to keep the temperature stable. However, once the system is pushed too far, over the critical point, the system will fail (i.e.&nbsp;move to the new attractor) quickly <em>without warning</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, one hypothesis is a 4°C rise could result in clouds thinning out <span class="citation" data-cites="Schneider_Kaul_Pressel_2019">(<a href="#ref-Schneider_Kaul_Pressel_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Schneider et al., 2019</a>)</span> (Quanta Magazine has an article <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cloud-loss-could-add-8-degrees-to-global-warming-20190225/">here</a>). At this point, Earth would be pushed into the basin of attraction of a new attractor, where cloud loss would result in more heat being trapped, leading to further cloud loss, and so on, forming a reinforcing feedback loop, which could add an <em>additional</em> 8°C for a total of 12°C increase. Humans would only need to cause the first 4°C, and Earth’s new feedback loops would cause the rest.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-disruptive-technology" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-disruptive-technology">Example: disruptive technology</h5>
<p>A disruptive technology pushes the present state of the market towards the basin of attraction of a different attractor. This is also why they’re so risky: until you cross the critical point dividing the new basin and the present one, the market’s dynamics work against you, pushing the market’s state back towards the status quo attractor. (Think of every new social media app, and how quickly they’re abandoned as people realize no one else is using them).</p>
<p>Truly disruptive technologies are able to cross the critical point, and at that point, the market’s dynamics become favorable. You effectively “cross over the mountains into a new valley”, so to speak. Smartphones have only been around for a little over a decade, and yet modern life is practically unimaginable without them: the technology has transitioned from “disruptive” to the “practically obvious”.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="humans-in-complex-systems">Humans <em>in</em> Complex Systems</h3>
<p>Because real systems have multiple attractors with highly non-linear dynamics, they can act counterintuitively to what humans expect. For instance, many expect a gradual, linear increase in average global temperatures due to global warming. However, our understanding of complex systems tells us that is the <em>opposite</em> of what will happen, in that many components of the system will remain as they are today before <em>everything</em> changes, without much warning.</p>

</div>
<p>The resilience of systems is what makes earth habitable, by keeping long term conditions stable.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> But it simultaneously blinds us by not allowing us to see the total consequences of our actions until we cross over the critical point (because change isn’t linear), at which point we’ll be fighting <em>against</em> Earth’s dynamics instead of working <em>with</em> them.</p>
<section id="example-geoengineering" class="level5 page-columns page-full">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example-geoengineering">Example: Geoengineering</h5>
<p>As the climate crisis worsens, there has been substantial discussion on whether methods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage">carbon capture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection">dimming the skies</a> could be viable solutions. I think it’s important to continue to research new ways to ultimately have as many options as possible. At the same time, it’s important to note that <em>when you mess with systems, they tend to mess back.</em></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="assets/system2.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption margin-caption">New technologies push the critical point further to the right. However, without changes to the system’s underlying dynamics, humans adjust their behavior to compensate, eliminating the benefit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>From a systems lens, the mere availability of such technologies will shift the critical point of the above system further right. This is because more options will increase the level of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration we <em>can</em> ultimately reverse.</p>
<p>But CO<sub>2</sub> concentration isn’t the correct problem! It’s the underlying dynamics of unprecedented fossil fuels consumption that is. CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations just happen to be the visible <strong>symptom</strong>. If you’re only solving for one part of a system, instead of a broader whole, you may be very surprised by the outcome!</p>
<p>Returning back to the fox-rabbit island, if you increase the maximum amount of rabbits the island can support (say, permanently increase the food available) <em>without</em> changing the feedback loops of the system itself, the difference <span class="math inline">\(r_{\text{max}} - r\)</span> would increase, and rabbit populations would simply grow to the new maximum the island can support.</p>
<p>In the case of geoengineering, the first order effect is that maximum CO<sub>2</sub> concentration that can be reversed will increase, which is great. However, it then gets accompanied by the <em>second order effect</em> of humans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation">adjusting their behavior</a> accordingly. (Think of every time a highway is expanded, only for the number of cars to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand">increase as well</a>). Indeed, a possibly dangerous outcome here is a system archetype known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_archetype#Shifting_the_burden_to_the_intervenor">shifting the burden to the intervenor</a>” <span class="citation" data-cites="Meadows_2008">(<a href="#ref-Meadows_2008" role="doc-biblioref">Meadows, 2008</a>)</span>, where we become <em>dependent</em> on frequent use of geoengineering to avoid ecological collapse.</p>
<p>Geoengineering can turn out to be a practical tool, but looking at the whole system, we must make sure its deployment is accompanied by changes to the <em>underlying</em> feedback loops<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>, such as a negative relation exerted on fossil fuel use by the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90583426/the-price-of-solar-electricity-has-dropped-89-in-10-years">plummeting costs</a> of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>We mean our technologies to do well, but technologies at the end of the day are just tools. What we really want to do, is <em>solve problems</em>, and we cannot do that effectively in complex systems if we fail to pay attention to second and higher order effects. Actions not only have consequences, but <em>chains</em> of consequences, and <em>all</em> those effects matter. As <span class="citation" data-cites="Hardin_1963">Hardin (<a href="#ref-Hardin_1963" role="doc-biblioref">1963</a>)</span> put it:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
As concerns the basic mechanism, side-effects no more deserve the adjective “side” than does the “principal” effect. It is hard to think in terms of systems, and we eagerly warp our language to protect ourselves from the necessity of doing so. (p.&nbsp;78)

<section id="conclusion-why-systems-thinking" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-why-systems-thinking">Conclusion: why systems thinking?</h3>
<p>Does systems thinking allow us to predict the future? Is it a theory of everything? No, and no:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No matter how well you model a system, our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality">rationality is bounded</a>, our measurements have errors, and our computers have finite power. There will always be some 10th order effect you’ll fail to take into account, and will completely mess up your predictions.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Systems thinking is <em>one</em> lens to view reality through. The lenses of math, physics, chemistry, neuroscience, biology, anthropology, art and culture all have value to offer, with their own strengths and weaknesses. Systems thinking is no different: it is <em>a</em> paradigm, not <em>the</em> paradigm.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So why bother with this? It’s because factoring in even second and third order effects allows us a richer model of reality than simple first order ones. Planet-level problems become tractable, as we realize inexplicable and contradictory behavior arises from fairly simple effects working <em>together</em>. Systems thinking allows us access to these concepts through a new lens, a shared conceptual language of feedback loops, attractors, chaos, emergence, archetypes and so forth; simply having words for them makes them easier to reason about <span class="citation" data-cites="Meadows_2008">(<a href="#ref-Meadows_2008" role="doc-biblioref">Meadows, 2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>And it’s because these effects are so common across a diverse range of systems, that we can rapidly transfer solutions from one domain to another, once we recognize them to have shared underlying dynamics. Nuclear arms races and price wars turn out to be two instantiations of the same dynamics. So does an opioid addiction and our reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Appreciating the full complexity of the problem then, if anything, allows us to <em>better</em> abstract it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_archetype">System archetypes</a> become similar to design patterns in programming: as we identify new, emerging problems as having similar dynamics to previous ones, we can quickly pull from a reference library of solutions to solve them. Systems thinking, in brief, allows us to build a better tomorrow, and I hope this essay has served as a helpful starting point.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Under specific parameters for the equations, that is. The most commonly used ones, and the ones we use here are σ=10, β=8/3 and ρ=28.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>For a visual representation, do see <a href="http://www.malinc.se/m/Lorenz.php">this</a>, using the “large cube” option. The “hide curves” option is particularly illuminatory.</p>
<p>Notice how for many different random starting locations, the points (represented by butterflies) ultimately converge to moving on the attractor manifold, instead of all of 3D space.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>It’s helpful to think of manifolds as “curvy objects” in a higher dimensional space. For example, a balloon is 3D object, even though it really has a 2D surface that <em>exists</em> in 3D space.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Explicitly listing assumptions in your models and methods is a practice I recommend. It’s easier to “debug” bad assumptions when you know what they are, as obvious as that sounds.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>I’d argue this is an even more unrealistic assumption than assuming the values are continuous. Every real system has delayed feedback. Stock markets are volatile because they’re acting on past information, even from a few seconds ago. Climate policies proceed at a glacial pace since the feedback from the environment takes years.</p>
<p>Delay is at the core of real systems, and I’d like to cover it more extensively in the future. But for curious readers: if you’re using a top-down model like differential equations, you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_differential_equation">Delay Differential Equations</a>. If you’re using a bottom-up model, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">Agent Based Modeling</a> techniques are flexible enough that you can integrate delays into the ruleset of agents, such as updating each agent at <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/27/e2025721118">random time intervals</a>.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Some readers may recognize these differential equations as modified versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations">Lotka-Volterra</a> equations. They indeed are!<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Also called a negative feedback loop, as the two relations work in opposite directions.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>The other type of feedback loop is a <em>reinforcing</em> feedback loop (also called a positive feedback loop), which is when two relations strengthen each other.</p>
<p>This can happen with either two positive relations or two negative relations. In both cases, it’s called a positive feedback loop as the two relations continually strengthen the <em>magnitude</em> each other’s feedback loops i.e.&nbsp;move in the same direction.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>And this is important, as if you only look at first order effects, some dynamics can seem downright bizarre.</p>
<p>For example, can harsher penalties for drug possession lead to more deaths? This seems counterintuitive. However, you notice the intermediate link is drugs becoming more concentrated, increasing the risk of an overdose as well. At that point, the causal chain seems plausible if not obvious.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>This can be direct, as in the case of the death of foxes being −γf. This can also be indirect depending on how we’ve written the equations (for example, the r<sub>max</sub> − r corresponds to (1-kr) in the first equation).<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>To understand why this is true, remember that when the rabbit population increases, so does the foxes, driving the rabbit population back down.</p>
<p>Even though many systems have components with reinforcing feedback loops, all real systems are ultimately bounded overall by balancing feedback loops, because the world is finite.</p>
<p>(e.g.&nbsp;even though pandemics spread exponentially <em>at first</em>, they slow down as there’s only a finite number of people left to infect).<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>And as we’ll see below, since systems can have multiple attractors, they can have a mix of both!</p>
<p>For say, humans, the non-point attractor would correspond to the everyday states of being alive, whereas the point attractor would be the equilibrium state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigor_mortis">rigor mortis</a>.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-rsC23Rk2s">this</a> for a nice illustration of the concept using the Lorenz.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>This is also why I entirely ignore 10 day weather forecasts. With current technologies, we can’t even predict a hurricane more than <a href="http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2010/teams/neworleans1/predicting%20hurricanes.htm">5 days out</a>!<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li><p>the creation or removal of new arrows on the diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>changing the <em>baseline</em> strength of existing arrows on the diagram (<em>before</em> the quantities are factored in).
