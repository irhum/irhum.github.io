<p>At their core, language models (LMs) are simply functions that assign a probability to a snippet of text. A common variant are autoregressive LMs: functions which produce a probability for the “next token” conditioned on some already written text, that is <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{token} \mid \text{context})\)</span>. Such a models can be immensely powerful, as many tasks can be re-written to fit into a “next token prediction” problem, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Factual Retrieval</strong>: If we want the answer to <code>"Where's the Eiffel Tower located?"</code>, then <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{"Paris"} \mid \text{context})\)</span> should be the largest value of all possible <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot \mid \text{context})\)</span>. If we then select <code>Paris</code> (as it has the highest conditional probability), we have the correct answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculator</strong>: If the context snippet is <code>"What's 16 times 4?"</code>, we should expect the highest probability token for <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot \mid \text{context})\)</span> to be <code>64</code>. This allows the model to act as a calculator!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Translation</strong>: If the context snippet is <code>"English: Hello! Spanish:"</code>, we should expect <span class="math inline">\(\text{"¡Hola!"}\)</span> to be the highest probability outcome for <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot \mid \text{context})\)</span>. Selecting <code>¡Hola!</code>, we repurpose the language model into a translation engine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulation</strong>: If we have the snippet <code>"The outcome of this six-sided die roll is"</code>, we should expect <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{4} \mid \text{context}) = \frac{1}{6}\)</span>. This allows the simulation of probabilistic events.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we had an <em>infinite</em> amount of text data, observing <em>every possible sentence</em> proportional to their “true probability”, estimating these probabilities is straightforward.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For instance, if we have a corpus with sentences of the form <code>"The outcome of this</code> <code>six-sided die roll is [x]"</code>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{6}\)</span>th of them have <code>x=4</code>, we could estimate <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{4} \mid \text{context}) = \frac{1}{6}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, if in our infinite corpus we have <code>"What's 16 times 4? [x]"</code>, and it is always <code>"What's 16 times 4? 64"</code>, we could estimate <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{64} \mid \text{context}) = 1\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have an infinite corpus. Even with a massive text corpus, we likely won’t observe most valid sequences of say, 100 words, even once since there’s an exponentially large number of sequences.</p>
<p>This post focuses on how neural networks allow us to build language models that can produce “good” next token probabilities for sequences that are “similar” (but not the exact same) as sequences in the training set, as first introduced in <span class="citation" data-cites="Bengio2003">Bengio et al. (<a href="#ref-Bengio2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. Reusing language from human learning, this is akin to <em>near</em> transfer <span class="citation" data-cites="Schunk2011-jg">(<a href="#ref-Schunk2011-jg" role="doc-biblioref">Schunk, 2011, p. 320</a>)</span>, where there is substantial overlap between the “training” and “test” contexts.</p>
<section id="levels-of-analysis" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="levels-of-analysis">Levels of Analysis</h3>
<p>Within any sufficiently complicated technical system, there are multiple levels that interact with each other, but are also distinct <em>from</em> each other. Disambiguating between them can provide a clean mental model to reason about them. I find it helpful to apply Marr’s levels of analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="Marr">(<a href="#ref-Marr" role="doc-biblioref">Marr &amp; Poggio, 1976</a>)</span> in such settings, and applying them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Computation:</strong> This is the abstract computation <em>any</em> language model does, regardless whether it’s using a lookup table, a transformer or a bio-inspired computer. Specifically for an autoregressive language model, it is the estimation of the conditional probabilities for the next token conditioned on the current tokens. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Representation:</strong> There’s multiple distinct ways to <em>parametrize</em> a language model. In this post we’ll explore and compare two: explicitly parametrizing each conditional probability, and using a neural network. We also need to decide how to <em>represent</em> raw text as individual tokens (is a single word a token? a single character?) and we’ll explore this too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Once we’ve decided on a representation for our functions and data, we actually need to implement them in code to get them running on hardware. This is the Python/JAX code we use in this article, and in turn all the kernels they execute to carry out the computation.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">This breakdown is subjective, and strongly dependent on the problem you’re looking at. If we were optimizing raw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Thread_Execution">PTX</a> instructions instead: the Python/JAX code may define the <em>computation</em>, the PTX being the <em>representation</em> and the GPU architecture-specific hardware operations the <em>implementation</em>. One person’s implementation level can easily be someone else’s computation level.</span></div><p>This blogpost focuses primarily focuses at the computational level, on what a language model <em>is</em>. There’s two distinct parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Part A, we take a deep dive on what it <em>means</em> to estimate a discrete probability distribution, and the combinatorial explosion in the number of outcomes that makes this challenging.</li>
<li>In part B, we step between the computational and representational levels, and learn that a language model parametrized by a neural network stores next token probabilities <em>implicitly</em> in its weights.</li>

<h1>Part A: Discrete Distributions</h1>
<section id="maximum-likelihood-estimation" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maximum-likelihood-estimation">Maximum Likelihood Estimation</h2>
<p>Suppose we receive a coin, and we wish to find out if it’s biased or not. We run 100 tosses, and 62 of them come up heads, so we figure it’s biased at 62% heads, 38% tails.</p>
<p>What just happened here? To rewind, the scenario looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support</strong>: We have a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, with exactly two possible<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> outcomes: heads or tails.</li>
<li><strong>Parametrization</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a discrete random variable, and each of its outcomes has a true probability value, <span class="math inline">\(p(0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p(1)\)</span>. We don’t know what these values are, so we <em>parametrize</em> a two-valued discrete probability distribution, with <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(1) = \theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(0) = 1 - \theta\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Sampling</strong>: Although we don’t know the distribution, we <em>can</em> generate samples from it by tossing the coin repeatedly. We gather a “dataset” of 62 heads and 38 tails.</li>
<li><strong>Estimation</strong>: We can then use these samples to <em>estimate</em> the value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Specifically, we can find the value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that <em>maximizes</em> the likelihood of the outcome we observed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, we can compute the probability we’d see a given outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability of observing one heads is <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.</li>
<li>Since each observation is <em>independent</em>, the probability of observing one heads and two tails is <span class="math inline">\(\theta (1 - \theta)(1-\theta) = \theta(1-\theta)^2\)</span></li>
<li>For the overall observation here, of 62 heads and 38 tails, we have <span class="math inline">\(\theta\theta...(1-\theta)(1-\theta)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{62}(1-\theta)^{38}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Independence between individual observations is a key assumption; if they’re not independent, <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{obs}) = p(\text{obs}_1)p(\text{obs}_2)...\)</span> doesn’t hold.</span></div><p>However, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a <em>variable</em> for which we need to <em>estimate</em> a value. One process to do so, is to see the above term as a <em>function</em> of theta <span class="math inline">\(L(\theta) = \theta^{62} (1 - \theta)^{38}\)</span>, known as the likelihood function. We can then find the value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that maximizes the likelihood function is a process, aptly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum likelihood estimation</a>, or MLE. This is the value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that, when used in <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot)\)</span> will result in the highest<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> probability being assigned to our observation.</p>
<p>Note that the likelihood function as is will produce <em>extremely</em> tiny values; for numerical stability, we usually <em>minimize</em> the negative <em>log</em>-likelihood, which here is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
-\ln L(\theta) &amp;= -\ln(\theta^{62} (1 - \theta)^{38})\\
&amp;= -62 \ln (\theta) - 38 \ln(1 - \theta)\\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Visualizing both, we see they are maximized and minimized (respectively) at the same value, <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0.62\)</span>, the same as our earlier “back of the hand” estimate:</p>

<p>This is because we estimated <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> with the value that maximizes the probability of the <em>observed</em> samples. In the limit of an infinite number of samples, the likelihood function will be maximized at a value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> that produces the true probabilities. But <em>in practice</em>, there will be variance in the number of heads in 100 samples (we may have 61 heads, or 58, or…); and in turn, variance in our estimates.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discrete-distributions-as-vectors">Discrete distributions as vectors</h2>
<p>We can write the probability mass function of the “coin toss” random variable in the following vector. Each entry simply stores the probability for one of the possible outcomes:</p>

<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/all.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:15.0%"></p>

</div>
<p>In general, for a discrete random variable with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> possible outcomes, there are <span class="math inline">\(V-1\)</span> free parameters. This is because all the probabilities must sum to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(V=2\)</span>, as in the case above, we have the probability for one outcome be <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. The other must then be <span class="math inline">\(1 - \theta\)</span> for both to sum to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(V=3\)</span>, we can have probabilities for two of the outcomes specified by <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span>. The third outcome then must have the probability <span class="math inline">\(1 - \theta_1 - \theta_2\)</span>.</li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(V=n\)</span>, we have the probabilities for the first <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> outcomes specified by <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span>, and the final one by <span class="math inline">\(1 - \sum_{i=1}^n \theta_i\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are potentially detrimental consequences when we “tie” the estimates of the probabilities of different outcomes, as we see next.</p>
<section id="constrained-estimates" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="constrained-estimates">Constrained estimates</h3>
<p>Suppose we have a discrete random variable with three possible outcomes (<span class="math inline">\(V=3\)</span>).

<p>As before, we don’t know <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot)\)</span>, so we approximate it with <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot)\)</span>. To find the best value of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, we use maximum likelihood estimation. We define two parametrizations <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot)\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>one that is free with <span class="math inline">\(V-1 = 2\)</span> parameters (<span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span>). That is, we can independently update <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(a)\)</span> without affecting <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b)\)</span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>another that is constrained to only have one parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\theta_c\)</span>). Note that <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b)\)</span> are now tied; updating one will also change the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>As like the true <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot)\)</span>, we can also write the outcomes of these approximations <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot)\)</span> in a vector:</p>

<p>On the left, in the “free” parametrization, the minimum is reached at <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1=0.038, \theta_2=0.007\)</span>, just as would be expected by estimating from the proportions directly (<span class="math inline">\(\theta_1=\frac{38}{1000}, \theta_2=\frac{7}{1000}\)</span>). In general, this is true for any number of outcomes <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>; the maximum likelihood estimate for each probability <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span> is the proportion of times said outcome appears in the entire dataset.</p>
<p>On the <em>right</em> however, with only one free parameter under the above parametrization, the minimum is reached at <span class="math inline">\(\theta_c=0.047\)</span>. This corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(a)=0.047, p_\theta(b)=0.047^2=0.002\)</span>.

<p>The lowest NLL reached here is <span class="math inline">\(207.19\)</span>. By plotting a contour back on the free parametrization (left), we can find parameter pairs (<span class="math inline">\(\theta_1, \theta_2\)</span>) with a lower NLL. With the free parametrization, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span> could be anywhere between 0.025 (2.5%) and 0.055 (5.5%) and still have a higher likelihood for the observation than the best value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_c\)</span>.</p>

<p>However, suppose we knew more about the problem: this is actually the annual failure rate of a widget, with a, b and c meaning “big gear failure”, “small gear failure” and “no failure”. Moreover, prior physical knowledge of the system informs us that the big gear should fail at 3x the rate of the smaller one, that is: <span class="math inline">\(p(a)=3p(b)\)</span>. This inspires the following parametrization, where this constraint holds for <em>all</em> values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_c\)</span>:</p>

<p>Let’s now look at a situation with two random variables. Suppose we now have the following setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have two time slots each day, each of which I can fill up with either reading or hiking.</li>
<li>The activity done in the first and second time slots are <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, let the joint distribution<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> of <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> be the following:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/joint0.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:100.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Note that these variables are <em>not</em> independent: for instance, if we learn hiking is the second activity of the day, we can deduce hiking could not have been the first activity that day, as <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{hiking}_1, \text{hiking}_2) = 0\)</span>. Estimation works the same as previously: if 21 of 200 observed days are “read first, then hike”, then <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{read}_1, \text{hiking}_2) = \frac{21}{200}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we note that each of the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>’s has the same <span class="math inline">\(V=2\)</span> outcomes: <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We could then convert the “vector” above into the following matrix:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/joint.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:40.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In general, with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> random variables, each with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> outcomes individually, there are <span class="math inline">\(V^m\)</span> total possible joint outcomes. Here, this is <span class="math inline">\(2^2 = 4\)</span> outcomes. One can imagine storing these joint outcomes in a tensor with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> axes, each with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> dimensions. Here we store these 4 outcomes in a <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> matrix; for 4 variables with 3 outcomes each we could use a <span class="math inline">\(3\times3\times3\times3\)</span> tensor (with 81 total “outcomes”).</p>
<p>Note that this grows <em>exponentially</em> in the number of outcomes. With <span class="math inline">\(V=10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m=10\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span> (ten billion) possible outcomes. <em>Each</em> of these is an outcome we need to observe (multiple times) to estimate the probabilities for. Compared to the previous <span class="math inline">\(V - 1\)</span> parameters for the distribution of a single random variable, we now have <span class="math inline">\(V^m - 1\)</span> parameters for the joint distribution of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> random variables.</p>
<p>This exponential growth (and in turn, the number of samples required) makes directly estimating probabilities for anything but the simplest of joint distributions intractable. Maybe conditional probabilities can help?</p>

<section id="conditional-distributions-as-vectors" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conditional-distributions-as-vectors">Conditional Distributions as vectors</h2>
<p>Conditional distributions also fit neatly into this tensor form. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule_(probability)">chain rule</a> in probability tells us that any joint probability can be decomposed into the product of conditional probabilities. Extending the previous example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(\text{hiking}_1, \text{reading}_2) = \textcolor{NavyBlue}{p(\text{reading}_2 \mid \text{hiking}_1)}\textcolor{Orange}{p(\text{hiking}_1)}\]</span></p>
<p>Here, the joint probability of “hiking then reading” is the product of <span style="color:#FF7F00;">the marginal probability of hiking first</span> and the <span style="color:#0077BE;">conditional probability of reading <em>after</em> hiking</span>. We can represent this factorization in vector form as follows:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/conditional0.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:100.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>To analyze this factorization:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve initially stored the joint probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot, \cdot)\)</span> in a matrix form. This has <span class="math inline">\(V^m = 2^2 = 4\)</span> outcomes, and so <span class="math inline">\(V^m - 1 = 3\)</span> parameters.</li>
<li>We can factorize that matrix into a vector <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot)\)</span> representing the marginal probability, and another vector <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot \mid \text{hiking}_1)\)</span> representing the conditional probability.</li>
<li>Each of these two vectors has <span class="math inline">\(V=2\)</span> entries, and so <span class="math inline">\(V - 1 = 1\)</span> parameters. With 2 vectors, we have 2 parameters total.</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears the factorized version has fewer parameters (2 vs 3) than the original. There’s just one problem: it’s incomplete! We’re <em>only</em> looking at the conditional probability table for where <span class="math inline">\(X_1 = \text{hiking}_1\)</span>; there’s another one for <span class="math inline">\(X_1 = \text{read}_1\)</span>:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/conditional1.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:100.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>With three vectors (one marginal, two conditional), we have 3 parameters, the same as the original joint probability matrix. This unfortunately is true in general as well; for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> discrete random variables (each with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> outcomes):</p>
<ul>
<li>the conditional probability vector of <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot \mid x_{1:k-1})\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> entries (<span class="math inline">\(V-1\)</span> parameters), as <span class="math inline">\(X_k\)</span> only has <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> outcomes.</li>
<li>However, there are <span class="math inline">\(V^{k-1}\)</span> such tables, one for <em>every</em> possible combination of prior values <span class="math inline">\(x_{1:k-1} = x_1, ..., x_{k-1}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The total number of parameters for a variable conditioned on <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> “already observed” outcomes then is <span class="math inline">\(V^{k-1}(V-1)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<section id="general-case" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-case">General Case</h3>
<p>The <em>general</em> chain rule for a joint distribution with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> variables is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(x_1, x_2,..., x_m) = p(x_m \mid x_{1:m-1})p(x_{m-1} \mid x_{1:m-2})...p(x_2\mid x_1)p(x_1)\]</span></p>
<p>Using the result in the previous section, let’s compute the number of free parameters in the distributions in the product above:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the marginal <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot)\)</span>, there are <span class="math inline">\(V-1\)</span> parameters.</li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot \mid x_1)\)</span>, conditioned on one outcome there are <span class="math inline">\(V(V-1)\)</span> parameters.</li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot \mid x_{1:m-1})\)</span>, conditioned on <span class="math inline">\(m-1\)</span> outcomes there are <span class="math inline">\(V^{m-1}(V-1)\)</span> parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summing up the number of parameters for all <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> distributions in the product, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
N &amp;= (V - 1) + V(V-1) + V^2(V-1)+...+V^{m-1}(V-1)\\
&amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} V^k(V-1)\\
&amp;= V^m - 1
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>We’re back at <span class="math inline">\(V^m - 1\)</span> parameters, same as in the joint distribution case. Breaking the joint probability matrix into conditional probability vectors <em>changes</em> the parametrization, but doesn’t change the <em>number</em> of parameters.</p>
</section>
<section id="independence-as-constraints" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="independence-as-constraints">Independence as constraints</h3>
<p>Earlier with the widgets example, we used context to reduce the number of parameters needed. Now suppose here, we knew that each of the <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> was a coin toss (with 60% probability of heads as before), and we had a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(m=30\)</span> coin tosses. There’s <span class="math inline">\(2^{30}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> a billion) possible sequences of coin tosses here. And you’d need to observe each of these billion sequences multiple times to estimate the proportion for each sequence compared to the total.</p>
<p>But it’s silly to store a separate probability for each unique sequence (e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\text{HTH...T}\)</span>): we know the coin tosses are independent from each other, and identically distributed. We could simplify the chain rule from before as follows:</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p> <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p_{X_1, X_2,...,X_m}(x_1, x_2,..., x_m) &amp;= p_{X_m}(x_m \mid x_{1:m-1})p_{X_{m-1}}(x_{m-1} \mid x_{1:m-2})...p_{X_2}(x_2\mid x_1)p_{X_1}(x_1)\\
&amp;=p_{X_m}(x_m)p_{X_{m-1}}(x_{m-1})...p_{X_2}(x_2)p_{X_1}(x_1)\\
&amp;=p(x_m)p(x_{m-1})...p(x_2)p(x_1)\\
\end{align}\]</span></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Note that here we explicitly subscript each <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with the random variable it is of. This is to clearly demonstrate when we drop them in the third line. We do so as we integrate the knowledge all variables are identically distributed (and hence have the same <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.)</span></div></div>
<p>This simplifies things greatly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, each <span class="math inline">\(p(x_k \mid x_{1:k-1})\)</span> required <span class="math inline">\(V^{k-1}(V-1)\)</span> parameters to represent: each conditional probability vector has <span class="math inline">\(V-1\)</span> parameters, and there’s <span class="math inline">\(V^{k-1}\)</span> such vectors as there are <span class="math inline">\(V^{k-1}\)</span> combinations of <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> previous outcomes.</li>
<li>But you don’t actually <em>need</em> a separate table for each combination of past outcomes: independence means <span class="math inline">\(p(x_k \mid x_{1:k-1}) = p(x_k)\)</span>. Each of the <span class="math inline">\(V^{k-1}\)</span> vectors are the <em>same</em> vector with 2 outcomes, which means there’s only <span class="math inline">\(V-1=1\)</span> parameter here.</li>
<li>Moreover, each of the <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>’s are identically distributed (since it’s the same coin), that is, they <em>all</em> share that <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, we see that as the coin tosses are independent, one parameter is sufficient to express the entire joint probability for <em>any</em> of the <span class="math inline">\(2^{30}\)</span> possible sequences. In general, knowing (conditional) independence between variables helps greatly: if (some) of the previous variables don’t change the probability, you don’t need a separate conditional probability vector for each of those previous combinations of outcomes. Here, we cut <span class="math inline">\(V^m-1\)</span> free parameters to <span class="math inline">\(V-1=2-1=1\)</span> parameter.</p>

<h1>Part B: Language Models</h1>
<p>We now have a detailed understanding of the joint probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> discrete random variables. Let’s now apply that knowledge, by looking at the scenario specific to language modeling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support</strong>: We have a sequence of random variables <span class="math inline">\((W_1, W_2,...,W_m)\)</span>, where each variable represents a “word”, more commonly called a token. Each token can be one of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> possible values, where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the size of the “vocabulary”.</li>
<li><strong>Parametrization</strong>: There is a <em>true</em> probability distribution the samples in our datasets are generated from. For example, the sequence (‘I’, ‘like’, ‘cats’) is sampled with probability <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'I', 'like', 'cats'})\)</span>. However, we do not know <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so we use an approximation <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Sampling</strong>: We assume any text datasets we have to be samples from this true distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Estimation</strong>: To <em>estimate</em> the value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, we find values that <em>maximize</em> the likelihood of our dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>In brief, a language model is simply a function that assigns probabilities to length-<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> sequences of text. To reinforce this, let’s look at an actual dataset.</p>
<section id="dataset" class="level2">

<section id="tokenization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tokenization">Tokenization</h3>
<p>Before building a language model, we must choose how to represent our raw text as individual “tokens” in a “sequence”. This requires concretely defining what the vocabulary for each token is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word-level</strong>: If each entire English word is a token, then the size of the vocabulary <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> grows quickly. This dataset alone has over 60,000 unique words.</li>
<li><strong>Character-level</strong>: If each individual <em>character</em> is a token, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is small (here, there’s only 67 unique characters, including whitespaces like <code>\n</code>.). However, for a given amount of information, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> needs to be much larger since there’s more tokens. For instance, “the weather in Berlin” is 4 words, but 21 characters.</li>
<li><strong>Subword-level</strong>: The most common way to build language models today is to use <em>subword</em> tokenization, such as using the SentencePiece tokenizer <span class="citation" data-cites="sentencepiece">(<a href="#ref-sentencepiece" role="doc-biblioref">Kudo &amp; Richardson, 2018</a>)</span>. These keep small words intact, but break up longer words into smaller “subwords”.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this article we’ll be tokenizing at the character level: it’s straightforward, and will allow us to directly visualize the probability matrices. Breaking up the first 75 characters into individual tokens, we have:</p>

<p>Note that our input pipeline looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{raw text} \rightarrow \text{tokens} \rightarrow \text{integers}\]</span></p>
<p>Now suppose we’ve set out to build a language model with context length <span class="math inline">\(m=1024\)</span>; that is, a model can assign a probability to all character sequences of length 1024. Even here, we run into combinatorial explosion: with <span class="math inline">\(V=67\)</span> characters and context length <span class="math inline">\(m=1024\)</span>, there’s <span class="math inline">\(67^{1024}\)</span> possible sequences.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> of those sequences would have zero probability (on a smaller scale, “big city”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> is a valid sequence of length 8, while “xcsazmad” is not), but even among the valid sequences, you’d need a truly staggering number of samples to even observe every valid sequence. Since this is infeasible, let’s try simplifying.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="chain-rule" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chain-rule">Chain Rule</h2>
<p>Using the chain rule as discussed earlier, we can represent any joint probability as a product of <em>conditional</em> probabilities. With <span class="math inline">\(m=1024\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p(w_1, w_2,..., w_{1024}) &amp;= p(w_{1024} \mid w_{1:1023})p(w_{1023} \mid w_{1:1022})...p(w_2\mid w_1)p(w_1)\\
&amp;= \prod_{i=1}^{1024} p(w_i \mid w_{1:i-1})\\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>In this case, it means iteratively computing the probability of each token conditioned on <em>all</em> the previous tokens. On its own, this is of little help. As before, although we’re “splitting up” the joint probability tensor, there’s still <span class="math inline">\(V^{1024} - 1\)</span> possible variables <em>in total</em>, since each “next token prediction” would need a unique conditional probability vector for each combination of previous words <span class="math inline">\(w_{1:i-1}\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="unigram" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unigram">Unigram</h2>
<p>What if we pretended, just like coin tosses, each token was independent of its previous tokens? This is <em>not</em> true: We likely have <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'h'}\mid \text{'t'})\)</span> greater than <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'h'})\)</span>, as “th” appears in “the”, one of the most common words in the English language. Knowing prior tokens definitely changes the probability of the next token.</p>
<p>But continuing forward with this naive assumption, we write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p(w_1, w_2,..., w_{1024}) &amp;= p(w_{1024} \mid w_{1:1023})p(w_{1023} \mid w_{1:1022})...p(w_2\mid w_1)p(w_1)\\
&amp;\approx p(w_{1024})p(w_{1023})...p(w_2)p(w_1)
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>That is, the joint distribution is the product of the marginal distributions. Since each marginal <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot)\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(V=67\)</span> outcomes, they have <span class="math inline">\(66\)</span> parameters. We make <em>another</em> naive assumption: each of the <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>’s are identically distributed<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. This means these 66 parameters are <em>shared</em> across all 1024 terms in the product above.</p>
<p>Note that with these two assumptions, we’re no longer estimating the probability of length <span class="math inline">\(m=1024\)</span> sequences, but rather <span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span>. We’re then assuming we can approximate the probability of a longer sequence with the products of these individual probabilities.</p>
<section id="estimation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimation">Estimation</h3>
<p>With the two naive assumptions above (independence + sharing across timesteps) we have 66 parameters that need to be estimated. We know the maximum likelihood estimate here from the previous section: count the proportion of times an outcome happened, among the total.</p>
<p>Let’s first split the corpus (of 4,573,338 tokens) into a training set (first 4 million) and a validation set (remaining 573,338).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>How good of a model of language is this? Even though <em>very</em> constrained, we can see it’s correctly “learned” a qualitative aspect of English: that <code>e</code> is the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency">commonly occurring</a> letter. But how do we know these frequencies are reliable, and not due to idiosyncrasies in the first 4 million tokens<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>?</p>
<p>One metric commonly used for language models is perplexity, which works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each token, compute the log probability of that token under the model.</li>
<li>Take the mean of the log probability across all tokens.</li>
<li>Take the negative exponential of this mean.</li>
</ul>

<p>Computing the perplexity over the training and test sets, we have <code>train_ppl=27.53</code>, and <code>valid_ppl=27.14</code>.

</section>
<section id="bigrams" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bigrams">Bigrams</h2>
<p>Instead of assuming each token is independent, let’s assume that a token <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> and tokens <span class="math inline">\(w_{i-2}, w_{i-3}...\)</span> are conditionally independent, given token <span class="math inline">\(w_{i-1}\)</span>. This means if we know the immediately previous token, knowing tokens more previous will <em>not</em> change the probability. We have the approximation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p(w_1, w_2,..., w_{1024}) &amp;= p(w_{1024} \mid w_{1:1023})p(w_{1023} \mid w_{1:1022})...p(w_2\mid w_1)p(w_1)\\
&amp;\approx p(w_{1024} \mid w_{1023})p(w_{1023} \mid w_{1022})...p(w_2\mid w_{1})p(w_1)
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Again, this is a faulty approximation: <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'e'}\mid \text{'h'}, \text{'t'})\)</span> is greater than <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'e'}\mid \text{'h'})\)</span>, as knowing the first two letters <code>th</code> would give us much stronger confidence in the completion <code>the</code> than just the previous letter <code>h</code>. But it is better than assuming complete independence between tokens.</p>
<p>For each conditional probability term, there’s <span class="math inline">\(V(V-1)\)</span> parameters as we need one vector for each possible “prior” token. If we share these parameters across timesteps as before<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, then there’s <span class="math inline">\(V(V-1)\)</span> parameters in <em>total</em> to be estimated to be able to compute the conditional probabilities. With <span class="math inline">\(V=67\)</span>, this is 4422 free parameters.</p>
<!-- [^marginal]: For now, we focus on only estimating the conditional probabilities (and not the marginals). As we'll see, more advanced methods like RNNs and Transformers can approximate both the conditionals and marginals with one function. -->
<section id="estimation-1" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimation-1">Estimation</h3>
<p>Estimation with maximum likelihood remains similar: To estimate <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b \mid a) = \theta_{a,b}\)</span>, we find <em>all</em> the cases where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> happens, and then compute the proportion of them that are followed by <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.

This resulted in a <span class="math inline">\(67 \times 67\)</span> matrix<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But we only <em>need</em> an individual parameter for each conditional probability in <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta\)</span>, if we want to be able to update a probability without altering the others. If we’re okay with a constrained parametrization, we can use just about anything: a Fourier series, a sequence of piecewise linear functions, etc. Since neural networks are universal function approximators<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="Hornik">(<a href="#ref-Hornik" role="doc-biblioref">Hornik, 1991</a>)</span>, we could represent <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta\)</span> using a neural network; that is <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b \mid a) = f_\theta(a)[b]\)</span>. In detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong>: The neural network takes in the token <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> as input, and returns a vector of probabilities corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot \mid a)\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong>: We then index into this vector with <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, getting the probability <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b \mid a)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a problem here: while the output (a probability) is continuous, the input <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (a token) is a discrete integer. We can’t use backpropagation here, since we can’t differentiate through <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Or can we?</p>
<section id="embeddings" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embeddings">Embeddings</h4>
<p>One approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding">embedding vectors</a>: we associate a real valued vector with each token in the vocabulary, and use <em>that</em> as an input to the neural network:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="assets/embed.svg" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:50.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This converts the continuous nature of neural networks from a <em>problem</em> to a <em>feature</em>. Recall that with continuous functions, small changes in the input result in small changes in output.</p>
<p>If the next token probabilities (the outputs) for any two tokens <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are similar (that is, <span class="math inline">\(p(\cdot \mid p) \approx p(\cdot \mid q)\)</span>, then during training, the embedding vectors for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> (the inputs) can be optimized to be close to each other (again, similar inputs <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> similar outputs). Instead of a human defining a hard constraint (such as <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{p, \cdot} = \theta_{q, \cdot}\)</span> if we were using explicit conditional probability vectors), the network can <em>learn</em> these associations directly from data.</p>
<p>Note that our input pipeline now looks like this: in doing so, we convert a raw string into a sequence of vectors.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{raw text} \rightarrow \text{tokens} \rightarrow \text{integers} \rightarrow \text{embedding vectors}\]</span></p>

<section id="training" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training">Training</h4>
<p>Training (or learning) really is just a concise way of saying “solving an optimization problem”. Specifically, the following problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\min_\theta [-\ln L(\theta)]\]</span></p>
<p>That is, we wish to:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the values of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of the neural network</li>
<li>that minimize the negative log-likelihood of our observed training sequence<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
<li>or equivalently, <em>maximize</em> the probability of our observed training sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike previously, where we “knew” the closed-form, optimal solution (calculate the proportion of the total), this is a considerably more complex parametrization with no closed form solution<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. After all, instead of having each <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b \mid a)\)</span> represented by a separate parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{a, b}\)</span>, we now have <em>every</em> parameter being used to compute <em>every</em> conditional probability.</p>
<p>We instead use gradient descent to iteratively estimate values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> with lower negative log-likelihood. We set up a simple neural network with 2 hidden layers as follows:</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the outputs. Recall that the network parametrizes <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b \mid a) = f_\theta(a)[b]\)</span>. We can compute all the conditional probability vectors <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot \mid a) = f_\theta(a)\)</span> by passing in all 67 unique values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Doing so, and concatenating these vectors into a matrix, we have a matrix quite similar to that from the previous section:</p>

<p>The similarity arises because, despite the different parametrizations, both of these models have the same objective: produce values of <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b \mid a)\)</span> for pairs of tokens <span class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span>, that minimizes the negative log-likelihood of the training sequence. If for 100 appearances of <code>e</code>, 10 are followed by <code>o</code>, then the maximum likelihood estimate is <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{'o'} \mid \text{'e'}) = \frac{10}{100}\)</span>, regardless if its parametrized with individual parameters or a neural network.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at the embedding vectors associated with each token, after training is completed. Since these are 16-dimensional vectors, we project them down to 2 using PCA:</p>

<p>There’s substantial structure here: the embeddings for the capital letters and lowercase letters form distinct groupings. Conceptually, this makes sense: the next token probabilities (the output) for all capital letter tokens (the input) are likely to have higher probability placed on lowercase letters (than just a lowercase <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> lowercase transition). Since their outputs share that similarity, their input embeddings should be similar (but <em>not</em> same) too.</p>

<p>The neural network in the previous section had 7,360 free parameters; whereas the matrix of conditional probabilities only had 4,422. The neural net appears to consume more memory <em>and</em> has a higher validation perplexity than the explicit parametrization. But now, instead of conditioning on the previous token, let’s condition on the previous <em>seven</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
p(x_1, x_2,..., x_{1024}) &amp;= p(x_{1024} \mid x_{1023}, ..., x_{1})p(x_{1023} \mid x_{1022}, ..., x_{1})...\\
&amp;\approx p(x_{1024} \mid x_{1023}, ..., x_{1017})p(x_{1023} \mid x_{1022}, ..., x_{1016})...\\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>We continue the “shared across timesteps” assumption; that is, the next token probability only depends on the previous 7, and not what numbered token it is in the sequence. Even then, conditioning on 7 tokens we’d have <span class="math inline">\(67^7(67-1) \approx 10^{14}\)</span> parameters. Since <em>most</em> combinations of the previous 7 tokens are invalid, we could use a sparse representation, but we’d still need a <em>huge</em> number of samples to accurately estimate next token probabilities.</p>
<p>But we could also just parametrize this with a neural network, as <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(x_i \mid x_{i-1},...,x_{i-7}) =\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(f_\theta(x_{i-1},...,x_{i-7})[x_i]\)</span>.

<p>The train perplexity shows a substantial improvement, at <code>5.80</code> for this constrained 8-gram model vs <code>11.87</code> for the “free” bigram model<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>. The learned function stores the next-token conditional probability vectors for all <span class="math inline">\(67^7\)</span> possible sequences of prior tokens. Most of this space of <span class="math inline">\(67^7\)</span> sequences are nonsensical (like “gsdaksx”). But of the ones in its training set, it is able to exploit shared structure between similar sequences<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> to predict similar conditional probabilities.</p>
<section id="constraints-as-generalization" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="constraints-as-generalization">Constraints as Generalization</h4>
<p>Earlier in the widgets example, we saw that having <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(a)=\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b)=\theta^2\)</span> effectively <em>tied</em> their probability estimates together. This has a key consequence: If in a larger sample we saw a lower proportion of outcomes <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, we couldn’t decrease <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(a)\)</span> without <em>also</em> decreasing <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(b)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This behavior carries over when we use a neural network. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We train a bigram model (parametrized by a neural network), with sequences tokenized at the <em>word</em>-level.</li>
<li>During training, the model learns an embedding vector for <code>"dog"</code> that is <em>very</em> close to the one for <code>"cat"</code>.</li>
<li>A training minibatch contains the token pair <code>("dog", "sad")</code>, and the optimization process attempts to increase <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{'sad'} \mid \text{'dog'})\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{'sad'} \mid \text{'cat'})\)</span> will <em>also</em> increase as <code>"dog"</code> and <code>"cat"</code> have quite close embedding vectors. In a way, this is a feature: the network is able to exploit the fact both <code>"dog"</code> and <code>"cat"</code> are “similar”, and the former being followed by <code>"sad"</code> means the latter should also likely be followed by <code>"sad"</code>; it is able to generalize this update to another animal.</p>
<p>This generalization behavior is pointed out by <span class="citation" data-cites="Bengio2003">Bengio et al. (<a href="#ref-Bengio2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. In their example, a well-trained model should assign the same probability to the sentences “The cat is walking in the bedroom” and “A dog was running in a room”. Even if it sees only one during training, at test time the other will have similar embedding vectors, and in turn similar outputs.</p>
<p>But this generalization only works holds for a well-trained model, with a large enough corpus such that the embeddings have the correct separation. Suppose that in the “true” corpus, our dogs are sad and our cats are happy. The optimization process will only separate the embeddings sufficiently if we have <strong>both</strong> pairs <code>("dog", "sad")</code> and <code>("cat", "happy")</code> in our dataset. Without a requirement to predict different conditional probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{'sad'} \mid \cdot)\)</span> for each, we might have <em>unintended</em> generalization. And this is just one pair of embeddings.</p>

<p>Zooming in between the <strong>computational</strong><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> and <strong>representational</strong><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> levels here, we see a <em>macro-level</em> property arises: inputs with similar “meaning” have similar next-token predictions. At no point do we hand-specify the representation of each token; simply tuning the embeddings + weights over a sufficiently large corpus results in the “clustering” of tokens<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. Referring back to the <a href="#analysis">bigram model</a>, at the <em>micro</em> scale we do not explicitly optimize the embeddings for uppercase letters for “grouping with other uppercase letters”; it emerges organically.</p>
<p>And this emergent property, of token sequences with similar “meaning” having similar inputs, allows a neural network to effectively <em>compress</em> the conditional probability matrix into its weights, taking up less memory <em>and</em> achieving near transfer.</p>

<p>At their core, large language models (LLMs) are not fundamentally different from the models we look at here: they too are functions that produce a conditional probability for the next token, conditioned on tokens already observed. Their functions have considerably more capacity: the largest neural network we look at has 13,504 params and has a context window of exactly 7 tokens. The largest GPT-3 model from <span class="citation" data-cites="GPT3">Brown et al. (<a href="#ref-GPT3" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> has 175B parameters, and a context window of <em>up to</em> 2048 tokens.</p>
<p>But in keeping with the spirit of emergent properties <span class="citation" data-cites="emergent">(<a href="#ref-emergent" role="doc-biblioref">Anderson, 1972</a>)</span>, it’s not <em>merely</em> that these language models are larger; they’re also different. While they obey the “near transfer” properties described here (similar input embeddings <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> similar outputs), they also exhibit a <em>different</em> kind of generalization called in-context learning (ICL) <span class="citation" data-cites="incontext">(<a href="#ref-incontext" role="doc-biblioref">Min &amp; Xie, 2022</a>)</span>. With ICL, the prompt itself can be composed of a few “examples” (e.g.&nbsp;a few translation input-output pairs), that dramatically improve the model’s next-token prediction capabilities. This is hard to explain with just the “similar embedding vectors” property alone.</p>
<p>Our current understanding is that this behavior arises from “induction heads” <span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2022context">(<a href="#ref-olsson2022context" role="doc-biblioref">Olsson et al., 2022</a>)</span> that emerge organically during training in the Transformer networks <span class="citation" data-cites="Transformer">(<a href="#ref-Transformer" role="doc-biblioref">Vaswani et al., 2017</a>)</span> that parametrize these language models. One way to view this is a higher-order emergent property<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, that exists at the level of substructures in the network parameters (and not just the input embeddings as previously). ICL also appears to be dependent on <em>both</em> the use of Transformers, and the data distribution of natural language <span class="citation" data-cites="datadistribution">(<a href="#ref-datadistribution" role="doc-biblioref">Chan et al., 2022</a>)</span>. In summary, our understanding of language models paramterized by neural networks is necessary, but <em>not sufficient</em> to understand LLMs, as there are emergent properties specific to the use of the Transformer architecture.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-distribution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-distribution">Data Distribution</h3>
<p>In language modeling, we assume our data is i.i.d. drawn from a <em>true</em> distribution <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. That is, the proportion of a snippet of text in an infinite-sized corpus should be <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{text})\)</span>. But in our corpus, what we have can be better described as samples from <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{text} \mid \text{time})\)</span>, with different values of <span class="math inline">\(\text{time}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This has consequences: If the context is <code>The top song on the Billboard Hot 100 is</code>, then <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\cdot \mid \text{context})\)</span> will only be able to return conditional probabilities which minimized negative log-likelihood on the <em>training data</em>. The next token to this context snippet, in the real world changes on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100">weekly</a> basis!</p>
<p>This problem is particularly exacerbated with fact-heavy completions. Recall that language modeling doesn’t distinguish between the core structure of language, and one-off facts: they’re all just tokens. The “facts” are stored in the weights of the model, no different than the conditional probabilities for the next token of any input sequence. Two potential ways to improve on this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Edit model weights:</strong> The recent work ROME <span class="citation" data-cites="meng2022locating">(<a href="#ref-meng2022locating" role="doc-biblioref">Meng, Bau, et al., 2022</a>)</span> introduced a method called “Causal Tracing” to find the subset of model weights that most influence the “next token” conditional probabilities for the “fact tokens” in a sample sentence, and an efficient editing mechanism for those weights. Follow up work then scales this to editing thousands of “stored facts” at once <span class="citation" data-cites="meng2022memit">(<a href="#ref-meng2022memit" role="doc-biblioref">Meng, Sen Sharma, et al., 2022</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retrieval-based LMs</strong>: Recent models such as RETRO <span class="citation" data-cites="RETRO">(<a href="#ref-RETRO" role="doc-biblioref">Borgeaud et al., 2022</a>)</span> and ATLAS <span class="citation" data-cites="Atlas">(<a href="#ref-Atlas" role="doc-biblioref">Izacard et al., 2022</a>)</span> <em>augment</em> a large transformer model with access to a database. Other works such as <span class="citation" data-cites="internetLM">Lazaridou et al. (<a href="#ref-internetLM" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> directly use tools like search engines to add tokens to their input prompt. The overall effect is a model, which can learn to produce factual evidence by <em>copying</em> from retrieved data than by storing facts in its weights. Then, if the fact source is updated, the model simply copies the <em>new</em> information into its generated output.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="non-autoregressive-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-autoregressive-models">Non-autoregressive models</h3>
<p>The autoregressive, “generate a single token at a time, left to right” method we explore here is just <em>one</em> way to build a language model. A few recent papers that explore other strategies are<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The SUNDAE model introduced in <span class="citation" data-cites="savinov2022stepunrolled">Savinov et al. (<a href="#ref-savinov2022stepunrolled" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> trains an autoencoder that iteratively denoises a snippet of text. Of note here is Table 4, where they show results on code-generation experiments, and how SUNDAE can account for context tokens both <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> the token to be generated.</p></li>
<li><p>The SED model introduced in <span class="citation" data-cites="SED">Strudel et al. (<a href="#ref-SED" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> uses diffusion directly on the embedding vectors of tokens. Instead of generating left-to-right, this allows them to iteratively refine an entire snippet of text, at each step.</p></li>
<li><p>Fill-in-the-middle models explored in <span class="citation" data-cites="FIM">Bavarian et al. (<a href="#ref-FIM" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> restructure the <em>training data</em> from (prefix, middle, suffix) <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> (prefix, suffix, middle). This allows a standard left-to-right architecture to be repurposed to “infill” text.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, by leveraging shared structure, language models can store conditional probability tables for an exponential number of possible inputs. Many active lines of research continue to explore how these models work, and how they can be made better. And even today, because so many tasks can be rephrased as token prediction problems, they’re beginning to power a large range of practical products, and their impact will only increase as they improve.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Possible meaning “non-zero probability”<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>compared to other values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span><a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>For example, <span class="math inline">\(p(a) = 0.03\)</span><a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>We do keep the baseline constraint that the probability of all three outcomes must sum to 1.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>That is, the function that stores the probabilities of specific outcomes for both <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>, compared to <em>all</em> other pairs of outcomes.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p><code></code> is a character too, so there’s 8 in total.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>This carries on the <a href="#independence-as-constraints">coin logic</a>: the coin doesn’t care if it’s the 1st or the 100th toss, the probability for the outcome heads remains the same.</p>
<p>Likewise, <span class="math inline">\(X_{562}\)</span> having the same distribution as <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> means the probability for an outcome (e.g.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'t'})\)</span>) is the same at both timesteps.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Note an implementation detail: we add a 0.1 as a “starting count” for each of the 67 outcomes. We’ll get to this when we cover bigrams next.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>For instance, if <code>?</code> appears 10x more in the training set compared to the overall corpus, the maximum likelihood estimate <span class="math inline">\(p_\theta(\text{'?'})\)</span> will be 10x larger than <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'?'})\)</span> .<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Note that we begin computing perplexity starting at the 8th token, for both the training and validation sequences. Later in the article we’ll build a model estimating probabilities conditioned on the 7 previous tokens; adjusting now means the perplexity comparisons across all models remain comparable.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>1 is a computational minimum. In practice, language <em>itself</em> has a minimum perplexity larger than 1, and even the best model we’ll ever build won’t go lower.</p>
<p>Analogously, even with a perfect estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0.6\)</span> for the biased coin earlier, we <em>cannot</em> perfectly predict the sequence of heads and tails in a series of tosses; there is randomness <em>inherent</em> to the process itself.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>That is, if <span class="math inline">\(x_a = x_b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{a-1} = x_{b-1}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(p(x_a \mid x_{a-1}) =\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(p(x_b \mid x_{b-1})\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a sensible assumption, as <span class="math inline">\(p(\text{'e'}\mid \text{'h'})\)</span> should be the same regardless if <code>e</code> is the 2nd or 285th token: all the information needed to predict it is (assumedly) in the prior token <code>h</code>.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Subject to <span class="math inline">\(\sum_b \theta_{a, b} = 1\)</span><a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>We could have <em>technically</em> used a <span class="math inline">\(67 \times 66\)</span> matrix. For each of the 67 conditional probability vectors, once we know the first 66 probabilities, we can compute the 67th by subtracting the sum from 1. Here it’s just easier to have the extra column.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>In the case of infinite width; but even in finite cases, given sufficient width and depth they’re effective.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Note that in practice, we’re solving for <span class="math inline">\(\min_\theta [-\ln L(\theta) + R(\theta)]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(R(\theta)\)</span> is some regularization term (such as the squared sum of the weights <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \sum_i \theta_i^2\)</span>).<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>And many local optima, not just one global optima.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>The naive feedforward network we use here has its number of parameters increase linearly with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Here, moving from 1 to 7 inputs, we have an increase from 7,360 to 13,504 params.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>And 11.87 is <em>the</em> lower bound on training perplexity possible with the bigram assumption, since the probability estimates for each conditional probability were at the global minima.<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>Just as the <a href="#analysis">bigram model</a> did by placing all capital letters close to each other in input space.<a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>minimize negative log-likelihood<a href="#fnref21" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>the embedding vectors + network weights<a href="#fnref22" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>And this property was what drove key earlier methods such as Word2Vec <span class="citation" data-cites="Word2Vec">(<a href="#ref-Word2Vec" role="doc-biblioref">Mikolov et al., 2013</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>Existing in between the computation and representation levels.<a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>And I note this is hardly exhaustive.<a href="#fnref25" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
